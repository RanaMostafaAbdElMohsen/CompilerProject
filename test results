1. accessing a string is array accessing that we dont handle
string s = "hello";
char c = s[0];
-> parse error

**********************************************************************************
2. multiple initialization of identifiers
int a,y;
-> parse error

**********************************************************************************
3. the tab and new line aren't recognized as tokens. they can be as follow:
WHITESPACE  	: (' ' | '\t') -> skip;
NEWLINE     	: ('\r'? '\n' | '\r')+ -> skip;

We may need them in printing ! check next point!

**********************************************************************************

4. Actually a whole story about printing =') !

if we want to print a variable and a its value
x = 5 (equivalent in C code is: printf("x = %d",x); to get what I mean)

print 'x';			-> returns char
print " = ";		-> gives parsing error, because = isn't recognized in the TEXT terminal in the lexer
print x;			-> returns identifier

Also printing a space isn't supported XD ! everything will be like spaghetti without spacing

print "   " ;		-> gives parse error

may need to add a new terminal if we want to print the special chararcters.
**********************************************************************************

5. function 

bool f(int a, int b, int c)
{
	int x;
	return (a+b+c);		-> parse error, because we return an identifier, we should return an expression. changed it to expression, and parsing is 								successfull 
}

however this gives a parse error:

bool f(int a, int b, int c)
{
	return (a+b+c);		-> parse error, no match for stmlist. it is still a valid function that we should support i think :O 					
}

Solution that I tried:
made a new non terminal funcstmt, and changed the func production as follow:

func : type IDENTIFIER ORBRACKET arglist ERBRACKET OBRACE funcstmt RET expression SEMICOLON EBRACE   {printf("function\n");}
	   ;
	   
funcstmt :    stmtlist 
			| 
	   		;
	   		
This solves the above problem, but not sure if it may cause a problem for anything else.

**********************************************************************************


6. just a reminder, we re not supporting this:
++i;
the increment before the identifer. i dont think it's very useful, we dont need to handle it, but just thought about mentionnig it if someone thinks otherwise

**********************************************************************************

7. Function continued


bool f(int a, int b, int c)
{
	int d = foo();				-> gives a parse error: we dont differentiate between a function declaration with its implementtaion and its usage
	return (a+b+c,d);			
}

function implementation should be done in parallel with our main code, not in it probably like this:
func1()
{

}

func2()
{

}


As for the declaration: probbaly need to add a function declaration production: tried these: work for now; 

also added funcDeclaration in expression produtcion, so that it can work for assignments

funcDeclaration	: IDENTIFIER ORBRACKET funcDeclArgs
				 ;
	 
funcDeclArgs:	IDENTIFIER contFuncDecl
			 |	ERBRACKET
			 ;	
			 
contFuncDecl:	  COMMA IDENTIFIER contFuncDecl 
				| ERBRACKET
				;	   

***********************************************************************************

8. Function continued

bool f()						-> empty arguments aren't accepted XD ! 
{
	print Hello;			
}

A possible solution that fixes it: (Move the ERBRACKET with the arglist)
		   		
func : type IDENTIFIER ORBRACKET arglist OBRACE funcstmt RET expression SEMICOLON EBRACE      {printf("function\n");}
	   ;
   		
arglist:  type IDENTIFIER cont
		 |	ERBRACKET
		 ;

cont:  COMMA type IDENTIFIER cont 
	| ERBRACKET
	;
